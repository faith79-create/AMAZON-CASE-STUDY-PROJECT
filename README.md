 ### üß† Key Highlights/Summary

- High Discount Rating: Many discounted items still received poor ratings. Price cuts alone won‚Äôt ensure customer satisfaction.
- Most Reviewed Category: Electronics had the most reviews but also a wide range in satisfaction.
- Revenue Optimization: Focus marketing efforts on mid-priced, highly rated products in "Home Kitchen" and "Accessories".
- Product Opportunity: Products with moderate ratings but high volume reviews may benefit from improved quality or targeted feedback campaigns.
- Fastest Products: A few products drive massive engagement. Promoting these further can help with cross-selling.
